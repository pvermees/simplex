  <tt>simplex</tt> is a free and open data reduction program for
  Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometery (SIMS) that offers the following
  features:

  <ol>
    <li><tt>simplex</tt> processes mass spectrometer in logratio space
      (a.k.a. 'the simplex'), ensuring strictly positive isotopic ratios
      with appropriate (asymmetric) uncertainty estimates.</li>
    <li>Secondary Electron Multiplier (SEM) data are modelled with
      Poissonian statistics, ensuring adequate handling of zero count
      data.</li>
    <li>Error propagation is done in matrix form, and accounts for all
      source of systematic uncertainty, including inter-sample error
      correlations.</li>
  </ol>

  <tt>simplex</tt> handles data from both Cameca and SHRIMP instruments,
  using both single collector and (for Cameca) multicollector
  configurations, for either U-Pb, Th-Pb or U-Th-Pb geochronology, or
  stable isotope geochemistry. The program can be used in three ways:

  <ol>
    <li><b>Online</b>: This website allows installation-free access to
      the Graphical User Interface (GUI). It includes a number of
      built-in datasets that allow novice users to familiarise
      themselves with the software. The online GUI is less well suited
      for routine processing of large datasets.
    </li>
    <li><b>Offline</b>: For a more responsive user
      experience, <tt>simplex</tt> can also be installed on any computer
      (running Windows, Mac-OS or Linux), within the <tt>R</tt>
      statistical programming environment. To this end,
      install <tt>R</tt> on your system
      (see <a href="https://r-project.org/">https://r-project.org/</a> for
      details), and then enter the following commands at
      the <tt>R</tt> console:
      <pre>
	install.packages('remotes')
	remotes::install_github('pvermees/simplex')
      </pre>
      Once installed, the offline GUI can be started as follows:
      <pre>
	simplex::simplex()
      </pre>
    </li>
    <li><b>Command line</b>: Advanced users can write automation scripts
      or extend the functionality of the <tt>simplex</tt> package by
      calling it from the command line, using the <tt>R</tt> programming
      language. A detailed Application Profile Interface (API) is
      accessible from the console. To get started, type:
      <pre>
	help(package="simplex")
      </pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
