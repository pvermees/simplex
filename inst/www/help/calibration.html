  Four-step calibration of SIMS data.
  <dl>
    <dt>I. Calibration type - Choose one of two options:</dt>
    <dd>
      <dl>
	<dt>1. isotopic fractionation:</dt>
	<dd> The default setting for
	  multi-collector stable isotope data. Accounts for the mass
	  bias of isochemical isotope ratios such
	  as <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O. Uses the logratio mean of
	  a reference standard to correct the sample.
	</dd>
	<dt>2. elemental fractionation:</dt>
	<dd>The default setting for
	  single isotope geochronology data.  Accounts for the
	  chemical fractionation of multi-element isotopic ratios such
	  as <sup>206</sup>Pb/<sup>238</sup>U. Uses a calibration
	  curve of the form Pb/U vs. UO/U.
	</dd>
      </dl>
      It is usually not necessary to change the default option.
    </dd>
    <dt>II. Standard composition - Choose one of three options:</dt>
    <dd>
      <span class="show4geochron hide4stable">
	<dl>
	  <dt>1. specify manually:</dt>
	  <dd>
	    Manually enter the logratio composition of the reference
	    material, as well as its covariance matrix and a table of
	    text labels that pair the standard to the
	    measurements. The latter table contains the following
	    headers:
	    <table>
	      <tr><td>X:</td>
		<td>The logratio to be used as the independent
		  variable (x-axis) of the calibration curve.</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>Y:</td>
		<td>The logratio to be used as the dependent variable
		  (y-axis) of the calibration curve.</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>C:</td>
		<td>The logratio to be used as a proxy for common Pb.
		  Only relevant if the <tt>common+radiogenic</tt> option
		  is selected (see below for details).</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>slope:</td>
		<td>Either 'auto' or a numerical value, which fixes
		  the slope of the Pb/U-UO/U calibration
		  curve.</td></tr>
	    </table>
	  </dd>
	  <dt>2. load presets:</dt>
	  <dd>
	    Selecting this item of the pull-down menu adds a new
	    pull-down menu to the user interface, containing a
	    selection of commonly used reference materials with
	    preloaded values. Selecting one of these options populates
	    the three tables with those values.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>3. convert from age:</dt>
	  <dd>
	    Selecting this item of the pull-down menu adds two text
	    boxes to the user interface, specifying the age of the
	    reference material and its standard error. These values
	    can be converted to a set of equivalent logratio
	    compositions.
	  </dd>
	</dl>
	For each of these options, the standard composition can either
	by specified as:
	<dl>
	  <dt>1. common+radiogenic:</dt>
	  <dd>The U-Pb composition of discordant reference materials
	    can be specified as a mixing line between purely
	    radiogenic and purely non-radiogenic end members.</dd>
	  <dt>2. measured:</dt>
	  <dd>Alternatively, the composition of reference materials
	    can also be specified as the measured U-Pb composition of
	    the standard. This requires that the isotopic composition
	    of the standard tightly clusters around a specific set of
	    values. Any spread of the reference data along a discordia
	    line cannot be adequately captured by a single
	    composition.
	  </dd>
	</dl>
      </span>
      <span class="hide4geochron show4stable">
	<dl>
	  <dt>1. specify manually:</dt>
	  <dd>
	    Manually enter the logratio composition of the reference
	    material, as well as its covariance matrix.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>2. load presets:</dt>
	  <dd>
	    Selecting this item of the pull-down menu adds a new
	    pull-down menu to the user interface, containing a

	    preloaded values. Selecting one of these options populates
	    the two tables with those values.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>3. convert from &delta;-values:</dt>
	  <dd>
	    Selecting this item of the pull-down menu adds three
	    new items to the user interface:
	    <table>
	      <tr>
		<td>&delta;-values:</td>
		<td>A table with the isotopic composition of the
		  reference material, specified inconventional stable
		  isotope notation. (&delta; =
		  (R<sub>smp</sub>/R<sub>std</sub> - 1) x 1000 where
		  R<sub>smp</sub> and R<sub>std</sub> are isotopic
		  ratios measured in the sample and reference
		  standard, respectively)
		</td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr>
		<td>Covariance matrix:</td>
		<td>The covariance matrix of the &delta;-values.</td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr>
		<td>Reference material:</td>
		<td>
		  The isotopic ratios of the reference standard
		  (i.e. R<sub>std</sub> above). A pull-down menu of
		  commonly used reference standards is provided to
		  populate this table.
		</td>
	      </tr>
	    </table>
	  </dd>
	</dl>
      </span>
    </dd>
    <dt>III. Select standard aliquots:</dt>
    <dd>Enter the prefix of the standard in the text box to select the
      aliquots to be used in the calibration curve.  Alternatively (or
      additionally), individual aliquots can also be added or removed
      by entering 'yes' or 'no' in the appropriate cells of the table.
    </dd>
    <dt>IV. Calibrate:</dt>
    <dd>
      Click the button to construct a calibration curve, which is
      needed for subsequent steps in the data reduction chain. The row
      numbers of the table of aliquots can be added as labels to the
      calibration curve. This facilitates the identification of
      outliers, which can be removed by revisiting step III of the
      calibration procedure.
