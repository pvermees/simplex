    <dt>Examples:</dt>
    <dd>
      A pull-down menu with five pre-processed example datasets,
      including four Cameca 1280HR datasets from the Institute of
      Geology and Geophysics (IGG) at the Chinese Academy of Sciences
      in Beijing, and one SHRIMP-II dataset from Geoscience Australia
      (GA). Two of the datasets contain stable isotope data (for O and
      S) and the remaining three contain U-Pb and U-Th-Pb data.
      Choose the most appropriate dataset before uploading your own
      data.
    </dd>
    <dt>Description:</dt>
    <dd>
      A one sentence summary of the origin and purpose of the data.
    </dd>
    <dt>Instrument:</dt>
    <dd>
      Either '<tt>Cameca</tt>' or '<tt>SHRIMP</tt>'.
    </dd>
    <dt>Ions:</dt>
    <dd>
      A comma-separated list of names for the different mass channels
      analysed. Atomic ion channels must be named as a chemical symbol
      followed by an isotope number (e.g., '<tt>O16</tt>',
      '<tt>U238</tt>'). <i>If the column headers in your data file do
      not follow this format, then you can rename them here</i>.
    </dd>
    <dt>Numerators:</dt>
    <dd>
      A comma-separated list of names for the numerators of the
      isotopic ratios that are to be processed. The names must occur
      in the list of <tt>Ions</tt> shown above.
    </dd>
    <dt>Denominators:</dt>
    <dd>
      A comma-separated list of names for the denominators of the
      isotopic ratios that are to be processed. The list must contain
      the same number of items as the <tt>Numerators</tt> field, and
      may only contain names that occur in the list of <tt>Ions</tt>
      shown above.
    </dd>
    <dt>Blank:</dt>
    <dd>
      Either '<tt>nominal</tt>' (for Cameca data) or, for
      single-collector datasets, the name of a channel in
      the <tt>Ions</tt> field, or a numerical value with the
      background signal in counts per second.
    </dd>
    <dt>Load raw SIMS data:</dt>
    <dd>
      Here you can upload your own raw SIMS data. For Cameca data, select
      multiple <tt>.asc</tt> files. For SHRIMP data, select a single
      <tt>.op</tt> or <tt>.pd</tt> file. Support for <tt>.xml</tt>
      files will be added later.
    </dd>
    <dt><tt>Save</tt>:</dt>
    <dd>
      Save the data, settings and processing steps in a <tt>.json</tt>
      file for future reprocessing. This function can be used to store
      your own <tt>simplex</tt> 'template'.
    </dd>
    <dt><tt>Open</tt>:</dt>
    <dd>
      Open a <tt>.json</tt> file with previously analysed data and
      settings. This function can be used to open your
      own <tt>simplex</tt> 'template'.
    </dd>
