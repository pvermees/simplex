# simplex

**simplex** is an **R** package for SIMS data processing that takes
  into account the *compositional* nature of isotopic data. This means
  that only the relative abundances of the isotopes carry the useful
  information.

## Prerequisites

You must have R installed on your system (see
[http://r-project.org](http://r-project.org)).  Additionally, to
install simplex from Github, you also need the **devtools** package.
This can be installed by typing the following code at the R command
line prompt:

```
install.packages('devtools')
```

## Installation

To install the current development version of simplex from Github, type:

```
library(devtools)
install_github('pvermees/simplex')
```
