  The graphical output shows the drift correction (for single
  collector datasets) of blank-corrected SIMS data. Solid lines mark
  the durations of each mass spectrometer sweep. Black dots mark the
  starting point of each individual mass station within the
  sweeps. Dotted lines are exponential functions whose slopes are used
  for the drift correction but for no other purpose. Vertical axes
  have units of counts per second.
