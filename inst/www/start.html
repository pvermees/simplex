  Processing SIMS data with <tt>simplex</tt> is simple:

  <ol>
    <li>
      setup: load one of the built-in datasets, or choose one (for
      SHRIMP) or multiple (for Cameca) datafiles of your own.
    </li>
    <li>
      drift: click on the eponymous button and apply a drift
      correction to single collector data. This correction is not
      necessary for multi-collector data. Therefore, the drift option
      is hidden for the oxygen and sulphur isotope methods.
    </li>
    <li>
      logratios: click on the eponymous button and fit the
      drift-corrected data with logistic normal model that is linear
      in time. This calculation might take up to a minute.
    </li>
    <li>
      calibration: choose a reference material and specify the
      corresponding aliquots in your dataset by entering the
      prefix in a text box. Then click <tt>Calibrate</tt>.
    </li>
    <li>
      samples: apply the calibration to the samples by
      clicking <tt>Calibrate</tt>. If desired, you can specify a
      subset of the aliquots by entering their prefix in a text box.
    </li>
    <li>
      finish: plot, tabulate, or export the data to <tt>IsoplotR</tt>.
    </li>
  </ol>
