    <tt>simplex</tt> is a free and open data reduction program for
    Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometery (SIMS) that processes the
    measurements in logratio space (a.k.a. "the simplex").

    <tt>simplex</tt> handles data from both Cameca and SHRIMP instruments,
    using both single collector and (for Cameca) multicollector
    configurations, for either U-Pb, Th-Pb or U-Th-Pb geochronology, or
    stable isotope geochemistry. The program can be used in three ways:

    <ol>
      <li><b>Online</b>: This version allows installation-free access
	to the Graphical User Interface (GUI). It includes a number of
	built-in datasets that allow novice users to familiarise
	themselves with the software. The online GUI is less well
	suited for routine processing of large datasets.
      </li>
      <li><b>Offline</b>: For a more responsive user
	experience, <tt>simplex</tt> can also be installed on any computer
	(running Windows, Mac-OS or Linux), within the <tt>R</tt>
	statistical programming environment. To this end,
	install <tt>R</tt> on your system
	(see <a href="https://r-project.org/">https://r-project.org/</a> for
	details), and then enter the following commands at
	the <tt>R</tt> console:
<pre>
 install.packages('remotes')
 remotes::install_github('pvermees/simplex')
</pre>
	Once installed, the offline GUI can be started as follows:
<pre>
 simplex::simplex()
</pre>
      </li>
      <li><b>Command line</b>: Advanced users can write automation scripts
	or extend the functionality of the <tt>simplex</tt> package by
	calling it from the command line, using the <tt>R</tt> programming
	language. A detailed Application Profile Interface (API) is
	accessible from the console. To get started, type:
<pre>
 help(package='simplex')
</pre>
      </li>
    </ol>

    All three methods follow the same sequence of steps, corresponding
    to the six tabs at the top of this page.

    <tt>simplex</tt> is beta software that has not yet undergone
    rigorous testing. Bugs and suggestions can be reported on
    <a href="https://github.com/pvermees/simplex/">GitHub<a>, or by
    emailing
    <tt>p.vermeesch[at]ucl.ac.uk</tt>. Thanks for the feedback!

    Example datasets were provided by Dr. Yang Li (IGG-CAS Beijing)
    and Dr. Simon Bodorkos (Geoscience Australia). The development
    of <tt>simplex</tt> was supported by NERC standard grant
    #NE/T001518/1 ('Beyond Isoplot').
