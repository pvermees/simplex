<div>
  Applies the calibration curve of tab #4 to (a selection of) samples.
  <dl>
    <dt>Calibrate:</dt>
    <dd>
      Calibrate the samples and plot the results on a version of the
      calibration plot that is augmented with age estimates (for
      geochronological data) and &delta;-values (for stable isotope
      data).
    </dd>
    <dt>Label aliquots:</dt>
    <dd>
      Ticking the box uses the row numbers of the table of aliquots to
      label the calibration plot.
    </dd>
    <dt>Tabulate:</dt>
    <dd>
      Produces a table of calibrated isotope ratios with standard
      errors and covariances.
    </dd>
    <dt>log:</dt>
    <dd>
      Ticking this box reports the calibrated data as logratios.
      Unticking it exponentiates those values.
    </dd>
    <dt>Select samples by prefix:</dt>
    <dd>
      Specify the names of the aliquots that are to be calibrated by
      entering their first few characters.
    </dd>
    <dt>Aliquots to analyse:</dt>
    <dd>
      Alternatively (or additionally) to the prefix box, individual
      aliquots can also be added or removed by entering 'yes' or 'no'
      in the appropriate cells of the table.
